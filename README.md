# Gaiza

    Gaiza is a multipurpose bot that is in development to test the reaches of Java through the Javacord API
    
JavaCord api can be found here: https://github.com/Javacord/Javacord
    

Currently the bot has a handful of commands and listeners that can be utilized by anyone who invites the bot to their server

Bot invite link can be found here: https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=369295519576489984&scope=bot&permissions=2146561111
    
    A list of commands can be found on the bot through the help command. The default command usage for the bot is '$'. Prefixes are able to
    be changed by admins of the server.
    
A custom UWU restriction module is implemented with this bot and is active upon it entering a server. Anytime a user uwu's they will accrue a fine 
which logs their information and stores how much they owe. 

  Since the bot is currently run with absolutel links for the .bat file it will break upon pulling the code.
  
  If you wish to use any code from the bot just credit me with my github repo
